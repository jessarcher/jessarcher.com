"In this episode, Jess Archer, a full-stack developer, programmer at Laravel and podcaster, talks with us about her favorite text editor, Neovim. She explains what it is, how it works, how to install it and why she prefers it over Vim. We also discuss intentionally going outside of our comfort zones, and the importance of making that choice in order to grow."
