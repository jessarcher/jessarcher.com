# Hi there, <span class="whitespace-nowrap">I'm Jess Archer.</span>

I've been making computers do my bidding for over 15 years. I've done everything from designing websites to building the servers they run on. These days my passion is building web applications with Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind.

Some interesting projects I've worked on include:

* A chemical warehouse management system
* A marriage equality telephone robot
* A cryptocurrency trading robot
* Clinical data collection and storage
* Police software to help vulnerable people

I care deeply about open-source software, privacy, best practices, open standards, idiomatic code, and great user and developer experiences.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, woodworking, photography, spicy food, dark beer, motorcycles, and heavy music.
