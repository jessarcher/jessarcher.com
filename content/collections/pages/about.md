# Hi there,<br>I'm Jess Archer ðŸ‘‹

I've been making computers do my bidding for over 15 years. I've done everything from building servers to designing websites but my focus these days is building web applications with Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind.

I've worked on some pretty interesting projects, including:

* A chemical warehouse management
* A touch screen point-of-sale system
* A marriage equality telephone robot
* A cryptocurrency trading robot
* Clinical data collection and storage
* Software for the police

I'm passionate about open-source software, privacy, best practices, open standards, idiomatic code, and great user and developer experiences.

When I'm not coding I enjoy woodworking, photography, spicy food, dark beer, fast motorcycles, and heavy music ðŸ¤˜
