# Hi again, <span class="whitespace-nowrap">I'm Victor Ukam.</span>

My passion for problem-solving has driven me for more than 10 enriching years. I've done everything from building web applications with Laravel, Vue, and Tailwind to managing the servers they run on.

Some interesting projects I've worked on include:

* A job recommender system.
* A tool to help draft better documents with AI.
* A market place to buy and sell loan-funded products.
* A tool to help project managers write user stories with AI.
* A Deep leaning model to detect corrosion in underwater images.

I care deeply about open-source software, privacy, best practices, open standards, idiomatic code, and great user and developer experiences. Iâ€™m open to exciting opportunities where I can leverage my expertise to drive innovative projects and contribute to organizational success. <a href="mailto:victorjohnukam@gmail.com">Shoot me a mail</a>, Let's connect!

When I'm not coding, I enjoy cooking, working out and keeping up with friends and family.
