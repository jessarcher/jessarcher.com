# My tools of the trade.

It's fun to compare notes on the gear we all use, so consider this my entry in that conversation. It's also a good excuse for some affiliate links, right?

## Hardware

### [Lenovo ThinkPad T460p](https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadt/thinkpad-t460p/22tp2tt460p)
This is by no means the latest and greatest, but it's more than enough for web development&mdash;especially after upgrading to a 1TB SSD and 32GB RAM.

I also have the dock for it so I can easily connect to my screens, camera, microphone, keyboard, and speakers in one go.

### [Lenovo 27-inch FHD Monitor](https://amzn.to/3O7zHWb)
The 2560x1440 resolution is crisp and offers enough space to have two windows side by side. I screen share a lot so anything larger or ultrawide doesn't really work for me on Linux because X11 doesn't do fractional scaling, and Wayland sucks for screen capturing.

At 200% scale (which X11 can handle) this is the perfect resolution for recording a Laracasts course!

### [Drop ALT 65% Mechanical Keyboard](https://amzn.to/3E8mIzd)
I have a small collection of mechanical keyboards, including a HHKB Pro 2 and an IBM Model M SSK, but this simple 65% keyboard is my daily driver.

### [Sony Alpha 6400 Mirrorless Camera](https://amzn.to/3g4bMKK)
I *love* this camera. It has interchangeable lenses and it's small. Most of the time I combine it with a [Sigma 30mm f/1.4 lens](https://amzn.to/3ty6F8V) and a [HDMI capture device](https://amzn.to/3TEiKUB) to create a very fancy webcam. I also love to combine it with the super flexible [Tamrom 17-70mm f/2.8](https://amzn.to/3VdV9vl) for travel and family photography.

### [Herman Miller Embody Chair](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/embody-chairs/)
I've owned the black version of this chair for at least 10 years and it's still comfortable and looks great.

### [IKEA TROTTEN Sit/stand frame](https://www.ikea.com/au/en/p/trotten-underframe-sit-stand-f-table-top-anthracite-80510390/) with custom table top
I bought these legs along with a white 120x70 cm table top many years ago. It ended up being a bit small and I wanted some warmer timber colours in my workspace, so I made one at 160x74 cm and gave it a walnut stain and matte poly topcoat.

### [Wool Felt Desk Pad and Coasters by Minimal Desk Setups](https://shop.minimaldesksetups.com/products/desk-pad)
I really like the look and feel of this desk pad. It also makes it easy to slide my mouse and keyboard out of the way.

### [Audioengine A2+ Speakers](https://amzn.to/3EyVnHU)
These sound amazing and look great on my desk.

### Sennheiser HD598 Headphones
These open-back headphones sound fantastic and are very comfortable.

I did have an issue where one speaker stopped working, but I picked up another broken pair and Frankensteined myself back to a fully working pair.

They've been discontinued, but the [Sennheiser HD 560S](https://amzn.to/3AfdH6b) looks comparable.

### [Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Headphones](https://amzn.to/3O7HJOP)
There are times where I want closed-back headphones and these fit the bill nicely! They're not as comfortable as my Sennheisers, but the sound doesn't leak in or out.

### [BM-800 Condenser Microphone Kit](https://amzn.to/3V0BJtH)
I picked this up when I started podcasting and didn't really know what I was doing. I still think it sounds good so I haven't upgraded it yet. Check out my [podcasts](/podcasts) page to hear what it sounds like.

### [Behringer U-Phoria UMC22 Mic Interface](https://amzn.to/3O5xuKW)
This powers my microphone and gets the XLR output into my laptop.

### [Samsung Galaxy Buds2 Pro](https://amzn.to/3AbizZR)
This is my first pair of wireless earbuds and I love them. I won them by coming second place in [Tighten's Laracon 22 puzzle challenge](https://tighten.com/laracon/puzzle-1/).

## Software

My dotfiles are on GitHub at [https://github.com/jessarcher/dotfiles](https://github.com/jessarcher/dotfiles).

### [Fedora Linux with GNOME](https://getfedora.org/)
I've done my fair share of distro-hopping over the years, including building a custom [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) system. Once I lost interest in tinkering around, I settled on Fedora with GNOME.

### [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/conf.html)
A super-fast GPU-based minimalistic terminal with just enough features.

### [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
I spend most of my time in a terminal so a terminal multiplexer is a massive productivity boost.

### [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
Hands down my favourite and most useful piece of software. I got started with Vim in my late teens, so modal editing is fused with my brain now.

Check out my [Neovim episode](https://thingsworthlearning.show/episodes/neovim-with-jess-archer) on the *Things Worth Learning* podcast to learn why I love it so much, and then check out my [VimConf 2021 talk](https://youtu.be/434tljD-5C8) to see how I've set mine up!

### [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)
I'm a web developer so my web browser is very important to me. That's why I choose Firefox!

### [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
The ultimate framework for building modern web applications.
